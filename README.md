## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A browser. I recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

### Installing

Visit [this page](https://maxvalue.github.io/Bookmarks-Patcher). The program runs in the browser.

Export your bookmarks from your browser.

Load them into the program.

Choose the options you like.

Hit `Convert`. The browser will automatically present you the patched bookmarks file.

Save this file and _restore_ your bookmarks from this file.

## Built With

* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - The code editor I use
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - The web browser I use

## Contributing

Please open an issue if you wanna help or have questions.

### Roadmap
Things I already plan to implement, but didn't have yet:
- [] Support HTML bookmark files
- [] Better visual design: Show exactly what changes will be made using examples
- [] Turn https on or off for each site
- [] Select sites which should be patched

### Project History
This project was created because I (Max) was asked by a friend of mine to build him a program
which can update his browser bookmarks. I put this off for a very long time,
because I didn't know how to make a simple GUI with the programming languages I knew.
Since I am now more focused on web development, I realized that a web app is much more suited for this task.
